CLASSTRONOMY

General Assembly WDI-3 Project 1

Classtronomy provides online study guides for various subjects in astronomy. Students sign up for the site by providing and email. They are then given a list of subjects they would like to study. When a subject is clicked, they are taken to a page of information that includes small paragraphs of information, with bulleted facts, photo sets and videos to suppliment the raw data. After reviewing the study guide, they can take a quiz related to the information they just reviewed. If they do well on the quiz (80% or higher correct answers) they unlock a music video related to the subject.
